# As expected, the confidence and prediction intervals are centered around the 
# same point (a predicted value of 25.05 for medv when lstat equals 10), 
# but the latter are substantially wider.

# Interaction Terms -------------------------------------------------------

# The syntax lstat:black tells R to include an interaction term between lstat 
# and black. The syntax lstat*age simultaneously includes lstat, age, and the 
# interaction term lstat√óage as predictors; it is a shorthand 
# for lstat+age+lstat:age.

# Non-linear Transformations of the Predictors ----------------------------

lm.fit2=lm(medv~lstat+I(lstat^2))
summary(lm.fit2)

# The near-zero p-value associated with the quadratic term suggests that 
# it leads to an improved model. We use the anova() function to further 
# quantify the extent to which the quadratic fit is superior to the linear fit.

lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat)
anova(lm.fit ,lm.fit2)

# The anova() function performs a hypothesis test comparing the two models. 
# The null hypothesis is that the two models fit the data equally well, 
# and the alternative hypothesis is that the full model is superior. 
# Here the F-statistic is 135 and the associated p-value is virtually zero. 
# This provides very clear evidence that the model containing the 
# predictors lstat and lstat2 is far superior to the model that only 
# contains the predictor lstat. This is not surprising, since earlier we 
# saw evidence for non-linearity in the relationship between medv and 
# lstat. If we type then we see that when the lstat2 term is included in 
# the model, there is little discernible pattern in the residuals.

# Qualitative Predictors --------------------------------------------------

names(Carseats)
# The predictor Shelveloc takes on three possible values, Bad, Medium, 
# and Good. Given a qualitative variable such as Shelveloc, R generates 
# dummy variables automatically. Below we fit a multiple regression 
# model that includes some interaction terms.
lm.fit=lm(Sales~.+Income:Advertising+Price:Age,data=Carseats)
summary(lm.fit)

# The contrasts() function returns the coding that R uses for the 
# dummy variables.
attach(Carseats)
contrasts (ShelveLoc)

# R has created a ShelveLocGood dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if 
# the shelving location is good, and 0 otherwise. It has also created 
# a ShelveLocMedium dummy variable that equals 1 if the shelving location 
# is medium, and 0 otherwise. A bad shelving location corresponds to a zero 
# for each of the two dummy variables. The fact that the coefficient for
# ShelveLocGood in the regression output is positive indicates that a good 
# shelving location is associated with high sales 
# (relative to a bad location). And ShelveLocMedium has a 
# smaller positive coefficient, indicating that a medium shelving 
# location leads to higher sales than a bad shelving location but 
# lower sales than a good shelving location.
